## `Vite 2.x + Vue 3.x + Tailwind 2.x JIT âš¡`

This ready-to-use boilerplate includes:

- [Vue Router 4.x](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router-next)
- [tailwindcss/jit](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-jit)
- [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Alias `@` pointing to the `/src` directory

All packages are included and already configured.



I use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for development, and the only options selected are:

* ESLint on save
* Prettier on save

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alijuniorbr/vite-tailwind-eslint-prettier.git
